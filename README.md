# Wii Archive

After years of collecting homebrew, I've compiled everything together into two repositories.

- Homebrew Channel archive can be found [here](https://github.com/forwarderfactory/hbc-archive).

The archive contains many different files, but mostly .wad, .elf, and .dol files. There's both official,
unofficial (homebrew and warez) and dev stuff here.

Obviously a lot of files wouldn't fit here due to the 25MB upload limit so I'm not only mirroring this but also creating a release which contains EVERYTHING.
Since Nintendo might take this down (no big reason to, but still), I suggest you download the stuff or even mirror it for others.

#### Small note: A direct link to this repository may not be allowed in some communities (discord servers for example) either due to ToS or due to individual server rules.
#### I suggest you follow their rules and don't post a link to this repository. Thank you!

# Archive Contains:
Wii Forwarders, Wii Channels, Wii Exploits, Wii Homebrew Apps, Wii Development Stuff, Wii NANDs, and various other things.
Most is available through NUS
