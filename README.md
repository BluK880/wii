# Wii Archive by Forwarder Factory (v2) ðŸ’£
After years of collecting WADs, I finally managed to compile everything into one big repository where things can easily be grabbed.

I've had these on my hard drives, and a small part of it mirrored to Archive.org but I always had this feeling where I wanted to mirror it just in case my drive 
would break or something and I finally did it. The archive contains many different files, but mostly .wad, .elf, and .dol files. There's both official,
unofficial (homebrew and warez) and dev stuff here.

Obviously a lot of files wouldn't fit here due to the 25MB upload limit so I'm not only mirroring this but also creating a release which contains EVERYTHING.
Since Nintendo might take this down (no big reason to, but still), I suggest you download the stuff or even mirror it for others.

#### Small note: A direct link to this repository may not be allowed in some communities (discord servers for example) either due to ToS or due to individual server rules.
#### I suggest you follow their rules and don't post a link to this repository. Thank you!

# Archive Contains:
Wii Forwarders, Wii Channels, Wii Exploits, Wii Homebrew Apps, Wii Development Stuff, Wii NANDs, and various other things.
Most is available through NUS
