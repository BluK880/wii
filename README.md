# Wii Archive

After years of collecting homebrew, I've compiled everything together into two repositories.

- Homebrew Channel archive can be found [here](https://github.com/forwarderfactory/hbc-archive).
- Homebrew Applications and anything not HBC related can be found in this repository.

The archive contains many different files, but mostly .wad, .elf, and .dol files. There's both official,
unofficial (homebrew and warez) and dev stuff here.

Obviously a lot of files wouldn't fit here due to the 25MB upload limit so I'm not only mirroring this but also creating a release which contains EVERYTHING.
Since Nintendo might take this down (no big reason to, but still), I suggest you download the stuff or even mirror it for others if you're feeling extra nice.

# Archive Contains:
Wii Forwarders, Wii Channels, Wii Exploits, Wii Homebrew Apps, Wii Development Stuff, Wii NANDs, and various other things.
Most is available through NUS
