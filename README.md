# Wii Archive

Wii homebrew archive

## Note

Funnily enough, this repository is now **archived.** We still accept contributions here, including additions,
but contributions of forwarders should be uploaded on [forwarderfactory.com](https://forwarderfactory.com)

The goal is to slowly transition over there. That should be possible once the sandbox and mass download features
are complete.

## What does the archive contain?

This archive contains:

- Wii Forwarders
- Wii Channels
- Wii Homebrew apps
- Wii Homebrew packs
- Wii Development stuff
- Wii NANDs
- Wii Exploits
- Wii Source code

Software related to the Nintendo Wii in some way
Most is available through NUS
